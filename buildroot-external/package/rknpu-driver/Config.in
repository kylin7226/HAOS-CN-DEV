	  RKNPU (Rockchip Neural Processing Unit) kernel driver
	  for RK3588 series SoCs.
	  
	  This driver provides kernel-level support for Rockchip's
	  NPU hardware acceleration, enabling AI inference capabilities
	  on RK3588 platforms.
	  
	  Supports:
	  - RK3588 series (including RK3588S)
	  - Hardware AI acceleration
	  - RKNN model inference
	  - Memory management for NPU
	  
	  Note: This is the out-of-tree driver from Rockchip.
	  Main kernel Panfrost driver does not include NPU support.
