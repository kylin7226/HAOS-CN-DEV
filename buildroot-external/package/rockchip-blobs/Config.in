	  Rockchip proprietary firmware binaries for RK35xx series SoCs.
	  
	  This package provides essential bootloader blobs required for
	  Rockchip RK3588 series SoCs, including:
	  - ARM Trusted Firmware (ATF/BL31)
	  - DDR initialization firmware (TPL)
	  - Trust Execution Environment (TEE) firmware
	  
	  These blobs are required for proper boot sequence on RK3588
	  platforms like ROCK 5B, Orange Pi 5B, etc.
	  
	  The package downloads official Rockchip firmware from their
	  GitHub repository and configures U-Boot to use the appropriate
	  binaries based on the target platform.
